# Bamazon

Overview: 

Single command line storefront with a customer functionality that allows the user to view and purchase various items available in the store.

Setup: 

To run this applicaiton , you will need MySQL and Node JS installed on your computer.

If you do not have MySQL database set up, you can visit the MySQL installation page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL installed, you can create the Bamazon database and the products table with the SQL code found in bamazon.sql. You will run this code inside your MySQL client (like Sequel Pro or MySQL Workbench) to populate the database. Then you will be able to run the Bamazon customer interface.

Once you have the Bamazon database set up, run these commands in the command line to run the customer interface application:

git clone https://github.com/leahmunson/Bamazon.git

cd Bamazon

npm install

node bamazonCustomer.js
